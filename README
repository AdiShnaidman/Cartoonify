Project Title: Image Processing Toolkit

Description:
This comprehensive Image Processing Toolkit is a culmination of four parts, each addressing essential aspects of image manipulation and enhancement. 
The toolkit provides a versatile set of functions for image quantization, color channel manipulation, adding masks, and achieving a unique cartoonify effect.

Part 1 - Image Loading, Saving, and Displaying:
This section introduces foundational image processing functionalities. 
With functions like image_load and image_save, it enables users to effortlessly load, save, and display images, forming the groundwork for subsequent image manipulation tasks.

Part 2 - Color Channel Manipulation:
In this segment, the toolkit delves into color channel manipulation. 
The change_intensity function allows users to adjust the intensity of a specific color channel, offering granular control over image colors. 
The merge_channels function facilitates the merging of modified color channels to reconstruct the final image.

Part 3 - Quantization (Color Reduction):
Quantization, or color reduction, is a critical image processing task addressed in Part 3. 
The quantize function efficiently reduces the number of colors in an image, using simple calculations or advanced machine learning algorithms. 
The quantize_colored_image function extends this capability to color images, preserving visual fidelity while reducing the color palette.

Part 4 - Cartoonify Effect and Mask Operations:
The final part of the toolkit introduces advanced image manipulation techniques. 
The add_mask function enables users to blend two images seamlessly using a mask. 
The highlight of this section is the cartoonify function, which combines edge detection, color quantization, and other processes to produce a captivating cartoon-like effect on images.
